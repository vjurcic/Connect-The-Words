Description
----------
Connect the Words is a simple game for testing ones
knowledge of languages.

Goal of the game
----------------
The goal of the game is to clear each level by 
dragging words to their correct translation.

How it works
------------
Words are loaded from two text files HRV.txt and
ENG.txt. Those files contain the same words in
Croatian and English in the same order.

On the first line in the HRV.txt is the number
of words in both files that is used bi the game
to define an array of the correct size.

The words are read, shuffled and drawn randomly
on the screen, Croatian on the left, English on
the right.

All words are dragable and when "picked up" have
to be "dropped" on their translation or the player
looses a life.

The game goes on until the player quits or looses
all his lives.

The stat.txt file contains the players scores and
is read each time the game starts. If there is no
stat.txt file, the game creates it.

Future plans (maybe)
--------------------
1. Replace text files with a database
2. Find a way to add more words without making the game to big
3. Add more languages
4. Create a proper UI
